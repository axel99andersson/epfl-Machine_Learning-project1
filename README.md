# epfl-Machine_Learning-project1

This is the repository for Project 1 in Machine Learning (CS-433). This project is done by:
Axel Andersson (axel.andersson@epfl.ch)
Alfred Clemedtson (alfred.clemedtson@epfl.ch)
Eric Dannetun (eric.dannetun@epfl.ch)

The repository contains five Python files (ending with '.py'):

run.py: This file runs our model on the test set and creates a file with the predictions

model.py: This file contains code with which finds the best values for hyper-parameters of the model

cross_validation.py: This files contains functions which helps us perfoms cross-validation in the model.py file

preprocessing.py: This file contains helper functions to pre-process the data.

implementations.py: This file contains machine learning methods which are used in model.py


The train and test data should be loaded in the preprocessing.py file. In the functions: load_data() and load_test_data() there is a variable called "path_train_data", assign the filepath to this variable.
